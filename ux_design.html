          <h1>Europe 1477</h1> 
          <h2>An Overview</h2>
          <p>Designed for players with a passion for history and creative storytelling, each player has control of a nation which he or she must guide through the ages with storytelling, creativity, and strategy.</p>
          <h2>The Project</h2>
          <p>Similar games exist but are run though, and structured by, modifications to existing video games or in a forum setting. This often leads to the games struggling to attract players and ending prematurely. The goal of Europe1477 was to create a codified set of rules and algorithms to decrease the workload on moderators while providing a stable and friendly platform with the possiblity of expansion to allow custom-created games.</p>

            <h3>Students:</h3>
            <p>Students' needs would focus on the game providing a more interactive and enjoyable medium of education. There would be a large varience in level of student interest in such a game and therefore the game should be user friendly and reward players who are more invested without punishing students playing only as a school requirement.

These users would be most interested in Europe 1477 providing a dedicated platform. Many of these users are vetern players and moderators and would be interested in tailoring individual games to their personal tastes. Desired Features: <strong>b, c, d, h, i, k</strong></p>

          <ul>
            <h3>Designing the game:</h3>
            <li>Testing of similar existing game concepts</li>
            <li>Hundreds of hours of research on the political, historical, socio-economic, religious, industrial, military, and cultural climate of late Medeival and Renaissance Europe</li>
            <li>Writing and testing algorithms to strike the balance between realism and playability</li>
            <li>Allowing player freedom of choice to shape the game</li>
            <li>Creating structures to reduce moderator workload without limiting players</li>
            <li>Compiling statistics for each nation and constructing the map</li>
            <li>ALPHA test</li>
            <li>Refining gameplay</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>Designing the game platform:</h3>
            <li>BETA test for player painpoints</li>
            <li>Sketch layout designs for a platform that encourages communication and player creation</li>
            <li>Analyize and modify designs to ensure platform is robust enough for players who are more involved while not penalizing more casual players</li>
            <li>Identify basic components: player interface, contacts and chat features, game searching and hosting, templature and publication/update pushpin system</li>
            <li>Prototype platform with Photoshop and InvisionApp</li>
            <li>Identify secondary components for prototype expansion: moderator calculators and interface, ability to customize starting national statistics and map, ability to customize templates available to players</li>
          </ul>
